Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services storeing and accessing data over the internet, including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence. Cloud deployment can be applied through three different methods:

1. Public
2. Private
3. Hybrid

Cloud computing has three main cloud service models. It is also known as "Shared Responsibility Model" whereby the user responsibility depends on the cloud service type: 

1. SaaS (software as a service) > End users
2. PaaS (platform as a service) > Application developers
3. IaaS (infrastructure as a service) > Infrastructure & network architects
